# Notification System Update: Agent-Based Payment Notifications

## Overview

This update implements a new notification flow where:
- **Hosts** receive booking confirmation notifications (NOT payment notifications)
- **Agents** receive payment notifications for payout processing
- Payment processing is separated from host notifications

## Changes Made

### 1. New Agent Service (`api/services/agentService.js`)

Created a new service following SOLID principles to handle agent-related operations:

```javascript
class AgentService {
  static async getAllAgents()           // Get all agents in system
  static async getAvailableAgent()      // Get first available agent
  static async isAgent(userId)          // Check if user is an agent
}
```

**SOLID Principles Applied:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Handles only agent operations
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible for new agent functionality
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on User model abstraction

### 2. Updated Booking Notification Service (`api/services/bookingNotificationService.js`)

#### Modified Methods:

**`createBookingPaidNotification(booking)`**
- **Before**: Sent payment notification to host
- **After**: Sends payment notification to ALL agents
- **Reason**: Agents handle payouts to hosts, not hosts directly

**`createBookingApprovedNotification(booking, isAgentApproval)`**
- **Updated**: Now includes "Please proceed with payment" message
- **Purpose**: Clear call-to-action for clients after approval

#### New Methods:

**`createBookingConfirmedNotification(booking)`**
- **Purpose**: Notify hosts when booking is fully confirmed after payment
- **Target**: Host only (not agents)
- **Message**: Includes client info and confirmation details

### 3. Updated Notification Model (`api/models/notification.js`)

Added new notification type to enum:
```javascript
"booking_confirmed"  // For host confirmation notifications
```

### 4. Updated Booking Service Flow (`api/services/bookingService.js`)

The notification flow in `_createStatusChangeNotification` now:

```javascript
case 'approved':
  if (previousStatus === 'selected') {
    // Payment confirmed scenario
    await BookingNotificationService.createBookingPaidNotification(booking);     // → Agents
    await BookingNotificationService.createBookingConfirmedNotification(booking); // → Host
  } else if (previousStatus === 'pending') {
    // Direct approval scenario  
    await BookingNotificationService.createBookingApprovedNotification(booking, agentApproval); // → Client
  }
```

## Notification Flow Diagram

### Before (Problematic):
```
Payment Status Update → Host Notification ❌
                     → Agent (No notification) ❌
```

### After (Correct):
```
Payment Status Update → Agent Notification ✅ (for payout processing)
Booking Confirmed    → Host Notification ✅ (confirmation only)
```

## Implementation Details

### Metadata Structure

Payment notifications to agents include:
```javascript
metadata: {
  notificationType: "agent_payment",
  hostId: place.owner.id,
  hostName: place.owner.name,
  totalPrice: booking.totalPrice,
  // ... other booking details
}
```

Confirmation notifications to hosts include:
```javascript
metadata: {
  notificationType: "host_confirmation", 
  clientId: booking.userId,
  clientName: bookingUser.name,
  totalPrice: booking.totalPrice,
  // ... other booking details
}
```

## DRY and SOLID Compliance

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Agent lookup logic centralized in `AgentService`
- ✅ Date formatting shared via `_formatDate()` method
- ✅ Booking reference generation reused across notifications

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - `AgentService`: Only handles agent operations
   - `BookingNotificationService`: Only handles booking notifications

2. **Open/Closed Principle**
   - Services can be extended without modifying existing code
   - New notification types can be added easily

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - Services can be substituted with extended versions

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**  
   - Focused interfaces for specific operations

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
   - Services depend on model abstractions, not concrete implementations

## Testing

A test script is provided at `api/tests/notificationFlowTest.js` to validate:
- ✅ Agents receive payment notifications
- ✅ Hosts receive confirmation notifications  
- ✅ Payment and confirmation notifications are separate
- ✅ Agent service functionality

## Migration

Since the project uses `sequelize.sync({ alter: true })`, the new enum value will be automatically added when restarting the server with `npm run dev`.

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Payment processing vs booking confirmation
2. **Correct Business Logic**: Agents handle money, hosts handle bookings  
3. **Better User Experience**: Hosts get relevant notifications only
4. **Maintainable Code**: SOLID principles ensure easy future changes
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Agent service can be extended for more functionality

## Usage

The changes are automatically applied through the existing booking flow. No additional configuration is required. When a booking status changes, the appropriate notifications will be sent to the correct user types based on the new logic.
