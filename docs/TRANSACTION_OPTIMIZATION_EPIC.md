# PostgreSQL Lock Optimization Epic
## Working Within 64 Lock Limit on Managed Services

### ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary
Since managed PostgreSQL services (Render, Railway, AWS RDS) don't allow superuser access to increase `max_locks_per_transaction`, we must optimize our application to work efficiently within the default 64 lock limit by breaking large transactions into smaller batches and reducing lock contention.

### ðŸš¨ Root Cause Analysis

**Why We're Hitting Lock Limits:**
- **Auto-Migration on Startup**: When `npm run dev` runs, Sequelize automatically syncs models creating multiple foreign keys in single transaction
- **Complex Availability Query Operations**: 
  - `PlaceAvailabilityService.filterAvailablePlaces()` runs multiple nested queries per place
  - Each availability check requires locks on Bookings, Places, and related tables
  - Availability filtering with date/time parameters causes sequential database queries
- **Booking Conflict Detection Logic**: 
  - `validateBookingTimeSlots()` checks conflicts across multiple approved bookings
  - `findConflictingBookings()` performs complex time slot overlap calculations
  - Each booking creation triggers extensive validation queries
- **Deep Join Operations in Controllers**:
  - `getBookingWithAssociations()` joins Booking â†’ Place â†’ User â†’ Currency (4-level deep)
  - `checkTimezoneAwareAvailability()` loads place data with complex timezone calculations
  - Multiple simultaneous `findAll()` calls with deep `include` statements
- **Concurrent User Operations**: Multiple users accessing same resources causing lock contention
- **Inefficient Transaction Management**: Long-running transactions holding locks unnecessarily

#### US-LOCK-013: Optimize Availability and Conflict Detection Logic
**As a** developer maintaining the booking system  
**I want** availability checks and conflict detection to use minimal database locks  
**So that** the system can handle concurrent bookings efficiently within the 64 lock limit  

**Root Issue:** The core availability and booking logic contains several lock-intensive operations:

1. **PlaceAvailabilityService Complex Logic:**
   - `_checkPlaceAvailability()` runs multiple sequential queries per place
   - `_hasBookingConflict()` uses complex JSONB queries with EXISTS clauses
   - Availability filtering loops through places individually instead of batch processing

2. **Booking Validation Lock Issues:**
   - `validateBookingTimeSlots()` checks all approved bookings for conflicts
   - `findConflictingBookings()` and `findCompetingBookings()` perform nested time slot comparisons
   - `cleanupExpiredBookings()` runs before every booking operation

3. **Deep Association Queries:**
   - `getBookingWithAssociations()` performs 4-level joins (Booking â†’ Place â†’ User â†’ Currency)
   - `checkTimezoneAwareAvailability()` loads full place data with timezone calculations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Availability checks complete with maximum 10 database locks per operation
- [ ] Booking conflict detection uses batch queries instead of sequential checks
- [ ] Replace complex JSONB EXISTS queries with optimized indexed queries
- [ ] Implement availability result caching to reduce database hits
- [ ] Break deep associations into smaller, cacheable queries
- [ ] Add specific database indexes for time slot queries
- [ ] Optimize timezone-aware availability calculations
- [ ] Implement booking conflict detection using database-level constraints
- [ ] Create materialized views for complex availability queries
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring for availability operations

**Technical Implementation:**
- [ ] Replace `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM JSONB_ARRAY_ELEMENTS...)` with indexed columns
- [ ] Create separate `booking_time_slots` table to avoid JSONB queries
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for availability results
- [ ] Add composite indexes on (placeId, date, startTime, endTime)
- [ ] Use database views for common booking conflict queries
- [ ] Implement batch availability checking for multiple places
- [ ] Add query result caching for timezone calculations

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Core system performance)

---

#### US-LOCK-012: Implement Emergency Lock Release
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** tools to handle lock emergencies  
**So that** the system can recover from lock issues quickly  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Stuck transactions can be identified
- [ ] Long-running queries can be terminated safely
- [ ] Lock usage can be reset without data loss
- [ ] System recovery procedures are documented
- [ ] Emergency contacts and escalation paths are clear

**Priority:** LOW (Emergency procedures)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Guidelines

### High-Priority Lock Reduction Strategies

#### 1. Availability Query Optimization
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC: Sequential availability checks (High lock usage)
for (const place of places) {
  const isAvailable = await this._checkPlaceAvailability(place, filters);
}

// SOLUTION: Batch availability checking
const availablePlaceIds = await this._batchCheckAvailability(places, filters);
```

#### 2. Replace Complex JSONB Queries
```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC: Complex EXISTS with JSONB (Multiple locks)
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM JSONB_ARRAY_ELEMENTS("timeSlots") AS slot 
        WHERE slot->>'date' = '2024-01-01')

-- SOLUTION: Normalized time slots table with indexes
SELECT DISTINCT booking_id FROM booking_time_slots 
WHERE place_id = ? AND slot_date = ? AND start_time < ? AND end_time > ?
```

#### 3. Break Deep Associations
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC: 4-level deep joins (High lock usage)
const booking = await Booking.findByPk(id, {
  include: [
    { model: Place, include: [
      { model: User }, { model: Currency }
    ]}
  ]
});

// SOLUTION: Shallow queries with caching
const booking = await Booking.findByPk(id);
const place = await this.getPlaceFromCache(booking.placeId);
const user = await this.getUserFromCache(place.ownerId);
```

#### 4. Optimize Conflict Detection
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC: Individual conflict checks per booking
const conflictingBookings = await Booking.findAll({/* complex query */});
for (const booking of pendingBookings) {
  const hasConflict = checkTimeSlotConflict(booking, approvedBooking);
}

// SOLUTION: Database-level conflict detection
const conflictingIds = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT DISTINCT b1.id 
  FROM bookings b1, bookings b2 
  WHERE b1.place_id = b2.place_id 
  AND b1.status IN ('pending', 'selected')
  AND b2.status = 'approved'
  AND daterange(b1.start_time, b1.end_time) && daterange(b2.start_time, b2.end_time)
`);
```

#### 5. Implement Query Result Caching
```javascript
// Cache availability results for 5 minutes
const cacheKey = `availability:${placeId}:${date}:${startTime}:${endTime}`;
let availability = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (!availability) {
  availability = await this._checkPlaceAvailability(place, filters);
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(availability));
}
```

### Database Schema Optimizations

#### 1. Add Specific Indexes for Availability Queries
```sql
-- Index for booking conflict detection
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_availability ON bookings(place_id, status, check_in_date, check_out_date);

-- Index for time slot queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_time_slots_gin ON bookings USING GIN(time_slots);

-- Composite index for availability filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_places_availability ON places(start_date, end_date, blocked_dates, blocked_weekdays);
```

#### 2. Consider Normalized Time Slots Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE booking_time_slots (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id INT REFERENCES bookings(id),
  place_id INT REFERENCES places(id),
  slot_date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  INDEX(place_id, slot_date, start_time, end_time)
);
```

#### 3. Materialized Views for Complex Queries
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW place_availability_summary AS
SELECT 
  p.id as place_id,
  p.title,
  COUNT(b.id) as total_bookings,
  MAX(b.check_out_date) as last_booking_date,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT extract(dow from b.check_in_date)) as busy_weekdays
FROM places p 
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON p.id = b.place_id AND b.status = 'approved'
GROUP BY p.id, p.title;

-- Refresh periodically
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY place_availability_summary;
```

### Lock Monitoring Implementation
```javascript
// Add to bookingService.js
class LockMonitor {
  static async trackLockUsage(operationName, fn) {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const locksBefore = await this.getCurrentLockCount();
    
    try {
      const result = await fn();
      const locksAfter = await this.getCurrentLockCount();
      const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
      
      console.log(`${operationName}: ${locksAfter - locksBefore} locks, ${duration}ms`);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`${operationName} failed with lock error:`, error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
